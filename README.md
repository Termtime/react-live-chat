## Running the chat app
First run npm install on both the root directory and "client" directory.

Run the server that will handle socket.io connections with `npm run dev` in the root directory to launch the server with nodemon.

Then in the "client" directory you can do `npm start` to launch the app.

Server runs on 8000 port
